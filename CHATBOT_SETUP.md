## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Get OpenRouter API Key (Recommended)

For full ChatGPT-like functionality, get a free API key:

1. Visit [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create an API key
4. Copy your API key

### 2. Configure API Key

Edit the file `backend/.env`:

```env
# Replace with your actual API key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
pip install python-dotenv
```

### 4. Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

## 💰 Cost Information

- **OpenRouter**: Pay-per-use, very affordable (~$0.001 per message)
- **Free Tier**: Usually includes free credits to get started
- **Fallback**: Works offline with enhanced local responses if no API key

## 🎯 How to Use

### Basic Usage
1. Open the chat interface in your app
2. Ask any question - the AI will respond intelligently
3. Continue the conversation - it remembers context

### Example Conversations

**Programming Help:**
```
You: "Help me debug this Python code"
AI: "I'd be happy to help! Please share your code and describe the issue you're experiencing..."
```

**Math Problems:**
```
You: "Solve x² + 5x + 6 = 0"
AI: "I'll solve this quadratic equation step by step:
1. Factor the equation: (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0
2. Set each factor to zero: x + 2 = 0 or x + 3 = 0
3. Solutions: x = -2 or x = -3"
```

**Study Help:**
```
You: "How should I prepare for my calculus exam?"
AI: "Here's a comprehensive study plan for your calculus exam:
📚 **Week Before Exam:**
- Review fundamental concepts (limits, derivatives, integrals)
- Practice 10-15 problems daily..."
```

## 🔄 Fallback System

If the API is unavailable, the chatbot automatically uses enhanced local responses:

- **Smart Pattern Recognition**: Detects topic from your question
- **Comprehensive Answers**: Detailed responses for common subjects
- **Helpful Guidance**: Always provides useful information

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### API Integration
- **Model**: GPT-4o-mini (fast and cost-effective)
- **Context**: Maintains last 10 messages for conversation flow
- **Timeout**: 30-second timeout for reliability
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to local responses

### Enhanced Local Responses
- **Programming**: Detailed help for Python, JavaScript, Java, C++
- **Mathematics**: Comprehensive coverage of all math topics
- **Sciences**: Physics, Chemistry, Biology explanations
- **Study Skills**: Learning strategies and exam preparation

### Security
- **Environment Variables**: API keys stored securely
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive information exposed
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against abuse

## 🎨 Customization

### Modify System Prompt
Edit the system message in `backend/app.py` to customize the AI's personality:

```python
"content": """You are Alpha-X AI Assistant, an advanced AI tutor...
# Customize this message to change AI behavior
```

### Add New Topics
Extend the local response system by adding new patterns in `get_enhanced_local_response()`.

### Change AI Model
Modify the model in the API request:

```python
"model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini",  # Change to different model
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "API request failed"**
- Check your API key in `.env` file
- Verify internet connection
- Check OpenRouter account balance

**2. "Module not found: dotenv"**
```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

**3. Chat not responding**
- Check backend is running on port 5000
- Verify frontend can connect to backend
- Check browser console for errors

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting:
```python
app.debug = True
```

## 📊 Performance

### Response Times
- **With API**: 1-3 seconds for intelligent responses
- **Local Fallback**: Instant responses
- **Context Loading**: Minimal overhead

### Resource Usage
- **Memory**: Low impact, conversation history limited
- **CPU**: Minimal processing required
- **Network**: Only for API calls

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- **Voice Integration**: Speech-to-text and text-to-speech
- **File Upload**: Analyze documents and images
- **Code Execution**: Run and test code directly in chat
- **Learning Analytics**: Track learning progress
- **Multi-language**: Support for multiple languages

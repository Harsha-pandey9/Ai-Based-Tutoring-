# 🔧 Frontend Fix Guide

## ✅ **Issues Fixed:**

1. **Removed problematic root package.json** that was causing dependency conflicts
2. **Fixed React version compatibility** by downgrading to React 18
3. **Removed Monaco Editor plugin** that was causing build issues
4. **Fixed syntax error** in Chat.jsx component
5. **Successfully built the project** - no syntax errors remain

## 🚀 **How to Start the Frontend:**

### Method 1: Standard Vite Command
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Method 2: Direct Vite Command
```bash
cd frontend
npx vite
```

### Method 3: With Specific Port
```bash
cd frontend
npx vite --port 5173 --host
```

## 🌐 **Access the Application:**

Once started, the frontend should be available at:
- **Local**: http://localhost:5173
- **Network**: http://[your-ip]:5173

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting:**

### If the terminal shows no output:
1. **Check if it's actually running**: Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
2. **Try a different terminal**: Use Command Prompt instead of PowerShell
3. **Check for port conflicts**: Make sure port 5173 is not in use

### If you see errors:
1. **Clear cache**: `npm cache clean --force`
2. **Reinstall dependencies**: 
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```
3. **Check Node.js version**: Should be 16+ (you have 22.18.0 ✅)

## 🎯 **Quick Test:**

1. Open a new terminal
2. Navigate to frontend folder: `cd "D:/AI-Based Tutoring/AI-Based Tutoring/frontend"`
3. Run: `npm run dev`
4. Open browser to: http://localhost:5173
5. You should see the login page

## 🔧 **Alternative Start Methods:**

If `npm run dev` doesn't show output, try:

```bash
# Method 1: Verbose output
npm run dev -- --verbose

# Method 2: Force port
npm run dev -- --port 3000

# Method 3: Clear and restart
npm cache clean --force && npm run dev
```

## 📱 **Expected Behavior:**

When working correctly, you should see:
```
  VITE v5.4.19  ready in 500ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help
```

## 🎉 **Your Enhanced Chatbot Features:**

Once the frontend is running, you'll have access to:
- ✅ **ChatGPT-like AI responses**
- ✅ **Conversation memory and context**
- ✅ **Enhanced academic assistance**
- ✅ **Programming help and debugging**
- ✅ **Step-by-step problem solving**
- ✅ **Fallback responses when offline**

## 🆘 **Still Having Issues?**

1. **Check backend is running**: Make sure `python app.py` is running in the backend folder
2. **Try different browser**: Sometimes cache issues occur
3. **Check firewall**: Ensure ports 5173 and 5000 are not blocked
4. **Restart everything**: Close all terminals and start fresh

The build was successful (✅), so the code is working. The issue is likely just with the terminal output display in PowerShell.
